Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. This repository serves as a playground for me to experiment with basic OpenCV functionalities and document my learning process.

Projects
1. Drawing
In this project, I demonstrate basic drawing functions provided by OpenCV, such as drawing lines, circles, rectangles, and text on images.

2. Image Reading
Here, I showcase how to read images using OpenCV and perform basic operations like displaying, resizing, and saving images.

3. Image Manipulation
I explore various image manipulation techniques, including grayscale conversion, image thresholding, blurring, edge detection, and more.

4. Webcam Capturing
This project focuses on capturing video streams from a webcam using OpenCV and performing real-time image processing tasks.
